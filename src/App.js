      ----------------------
      --> Route will now help us to establish the link between componentâ€™s UI(element prop) and the URL(path).
      --> By default, Route is inclusive which means more than one Route component can match the URL path and render at the same time. 
      If we want to render a single component, we need to use Routes. Our application can have mutliple routes

      INDEX: 
      Determines if the route is an index route. 
      Index routes render into their parent's Outlet at their parent's URL (like a default child route).
